# 🎲 Guess the Number Game

A simple, text‑based Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number. The game includes multiple difficulty levels, input validation, a scoring system, and the option to play again.

This project was developed as part of a university assessment and demonstrates:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Git version control (multiple commits, branches, and merges)
- Clear documentation and code comments
